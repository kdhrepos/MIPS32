# Basic MIPS32 Integer Simulator

I created this simulator for students who are studying *Computer Architecture* for the first time, especially those using the book "Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface".

In the 4th chapter, you'll learn how the MIPS datapath works, which can be seriously confusing! 

For those of you struggling with MIPS and worried about your grade, **DOWNLOAD IT NOW**! You can find all the necessary details below.

I hope this helps you understand the MIPS datapath and achieve an A+ or A grade. 

*Good Luck!!!*


# Getting Started
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kdhrepos/MIPS32

make

./mips
```
# Instruction Support

# Datapath

# Execution Example

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
- Loop code or some complicated codes might not work well... üò≠
- EOP stands for End of Program. Literally, it denotes where is the end of the program in the instruction memory.
- Control signals are completely different from the book, „ÄéComputer Organization and Design : The Hardware/Software Interface„Äè.
